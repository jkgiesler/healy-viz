# Plotting Figures from Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction in Python

Figures are built using the excellent python package [plotnine](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine). Where I can't easily find toy datasets as python packages, I'm exporting them from the `socviz` package.

## plotnine issues found so far:
- Need to implement a custom smoothing function for GAM in `geom_smooth` (docs have example)
- No subtitle/caption in `labs`
